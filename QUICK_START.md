## 🛠️ NEXT STEPS

**After stakeholder review:**
1. Gather feedback
2. Run Step 7 (QA & Polish)
3. Fix any issues found
4. Changes auto-deploy via GitHub

**Every time you push to GitHub:**
- Vercel auto-deploys in ~2-3 minutes
- Your staging URL updates automatically

---

## ⚙️ OPTIONAL: Local Testing First

**If you want to test locally before deploying:**

```bash
cd BrandIQ2025
npm install
npm run build
npm start
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

**But honestly:** Just deploy to Vercel. It's faster and you get a shareable URL immediately.

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

**"Build failed":**
- Check Vercel build logs
- Usually: missing dependencies or TypeScript errors
- Solution: Run `npm run build` locally first

**"Videos don't play":**
- Expected on some mobile browsers (autoplay restrictions)
- User may need to tap to play
- This is normal browser behavior

**"Form doesn't submit":**
- Correct. Form is UI-only (no backend yet)
- Step 7 or post-launch will add backend integration
- For now, it just shows success message locally
