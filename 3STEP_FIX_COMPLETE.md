### **STEP 2: Strategic Partners Section Added**
✅ Added Personicom partnership showcase to `/services` page

✅ Professional card layout with:

## ⏱️ EXECUTION TIME

## 🔍 WHAT'S STILL MISSING (FOR FUTURE WORK)

### **Not Fixed in This Update:**
- ❌ **Client Logos:** Still using text placeholders on `/clients` and `/gallery` pages
  - **Why:** Requires FTP/server access or manual upload from your backend
  - **Workaround:** Logos are secondary; text-based client lists work for now
  
- ❌ **Additional Hero Videos:** Only 3 videos available (baseball, brick chisel, postcards)
  - **Why:** No additional videos found on live site (404 errors on other pages)
  - **Workaround:** 3 videos in rotation is sufficient for homepage

- ❌ **Partners Page Route:** No `/partners` page built
  - **Why:** Live site doesn't have this page (returns 404)
  - **Solution:** Partnership info integrated into `/services` instead (better UX)

---

## ✅ NEXT STEPS

### **Option A: Monitor Vercel Deployment**
1. Wait ~2-3 minutes for auto-deploy
2. Visit your Vercel staging URL
3. Test these pages:
   - Homepage (should still work)
   - `/gallery` (should show 6 unique case study images)
   - `/services` (should show Strategic Partners section)
4. Report any issues

### **Option B: Proceed to Step 7 (QA & Polish)**
- Now that real assets are integrated, run comprehensive QA
- Fix TypeScript namespace issue
- Performance optimization
- Final bug sweep
